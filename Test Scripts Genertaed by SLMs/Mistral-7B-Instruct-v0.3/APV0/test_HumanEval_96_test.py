Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_96_code import count_up_to
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    For example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2, 3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2, 3, 5, 7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
    count_up_to(1) => []
    count_up_to(18) => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    """

    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(i)
    return primes

 Here is a unittest test script for the `count_up_to` function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_96_code import count_up_to

class TestCountUpTo(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_count_up_to(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(0), [])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(1), [])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(2), [2])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(3), [2, 3])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(5), [2, 3])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(11), [2, 3, 5, 7])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(20), [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(18), [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(100), [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test script includes a test case for the `TestCountUpTo` class that tests the `count_up_to` function with various inputs. The `assertEqual` method is used to compare the expected output with the actual output of the function. The test script ends with the standard boilerplate for running the unittest tests.

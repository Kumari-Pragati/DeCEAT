Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_69_code import search
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such value exists, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''
    frq = [0] * (max(lst) + 1)
    for i in lst:
        frq[i] += 1

    ans = -1
    for i in range(1, len(frq)):
        if frq[i] >= i:
            ans = i

    return ansassistant

Here is the unittest test script for the given function:

Python
import unittest
from HumanEval_69_code import search

class TestSearchFunction(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_search_function(self):
        self.assertEqual(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]), 2)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]), 3)
        self.assertEqual(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]), -1)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]), 4)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]), -1)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), -1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test script includes 5 test cases to cover different scenarios. The test cases are designed to test the function's ability to find the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. The test cases also cover the scenario where no such value exists, in which case the function should return -1.

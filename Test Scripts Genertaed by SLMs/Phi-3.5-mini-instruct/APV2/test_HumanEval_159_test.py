You are an expert Python programmer whose primary role is to write comprehensive unittest test suites. Be professional, precise, and output only runnable Python code. Write a complete unittest test suite for the following Python function. 
Follow all rules carefully.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_159_code import eat
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    You should return a list of:
        [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
          the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    If there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Examples:
    eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    """
    if need <= remaining:
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else:
        return [number + remaining, 0]

 
import unittest
from HumanEval_159_code import eat

class TestEatFunction(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_eat_with_enough_carrots(self):
        self.assertEqual(eat(5, 6, 10), [11, 4])

    def test_eat_exceeds_need(self):
        self.assertEqual(eat(4, 8, 9), [12, 1])

    def test_eat_exactly_needed(self):
        self.assertEqual(eat(1, 10, 10), [11, 0])

    def test_eat_less_than_needed(self):
        self.assertEqual(eat(2, 11, 5), [7, 0])

    def test_eat_with_no_carrots_left(self):
        self.assertEqual(eat(3, 5, 0), [3, 0])

    def test_eat_with_negative_numbers(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            eat(-1, 5, 10)

    def test_eat_with_zero_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(eat(0, 5, 10), [5, 5])

    def test_eat_with_negative_remaining(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            eat(5, 5, -10)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


Note: The original function does not specify what should happen if negative numbers are passed as arguments. The above test suite includes tests for negative numbers to ensure that the function raises a `ValueError` as expected. If the `eat` function is not designed to handle negative numbers, you should modify the function to raise an error or handle the case appropriately.

You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_78_code import hex_key
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def hex_key(num):
    """You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    Examples:
        For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
        For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
        For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
        For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
        For num = "2020" the output should be 2.
    """

    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(num)):
        if num[i] in primes:
            total += 1
    return total

    unittest.main()


This code snippet defines a `hex_key` function that counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers. It also includes a `TestHexKey` class with several test cases to verify the correctness of the `hex_key` function. The `unittest.main()` call at the end runs these tests when the script is executed directly.

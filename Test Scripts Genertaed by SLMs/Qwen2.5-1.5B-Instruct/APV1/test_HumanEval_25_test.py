This code snippet defines a `factorize` function that returns a list of prime factors of a given integer, sorted in ascending order. It also includes a `TestFactorize` class with several test cases using the `unittest` framework to verify the correctness of the `factorize` function. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block runs these tests when the script is executed directly.

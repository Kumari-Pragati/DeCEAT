You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_107_code import even_odd_palindrome
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.

    Example 1:

        Input: 3
        Output: (1, 2)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.

    Example 2:

        Input: 12
        Output: (4, 6)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.

    Note:
        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3
        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.

This code snippet defines a `unittest` test suite for the `even_odd_palindrome` function. It includes several test cases based on the examples provided in the docstring as well as edge cases to ensure the function behaves correctly under various conditions. The `TestEvenOddPalindrome` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, which allows us to define methods to run our tests. Each method checks whether the output of `even_odd_palindrome` matches the expected result using assertions. Finally, the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block runs all the tests when the script is executed directly.

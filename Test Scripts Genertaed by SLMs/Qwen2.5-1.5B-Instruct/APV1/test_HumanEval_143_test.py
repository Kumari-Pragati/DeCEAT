You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_143_code import words_in_sentence
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
        Output: "go for"

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters

This code snippet defines a `TestWordsInSentence` class within the `unittest` module, which inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. The class includes several test methods to verify the correctness of the `words_in_sentence` function under various conditions.

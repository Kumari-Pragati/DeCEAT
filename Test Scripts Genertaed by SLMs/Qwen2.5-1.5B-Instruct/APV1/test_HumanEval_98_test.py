import unittest

# Function to be tested
from HumanEval_98_code import count_upper

class TestCountUpper(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_count_upper(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_upper('aBCdEf'), 1)
        self.assertEqual(count_upper('abcdefg'), 0)
        self.assertEqual(count_upper('dBBE'), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This code snippet defines a `TestCountUpper` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains a single method `test_count_upper`, which tests the `count_upper` function using assertEqual statements to check if it returns the expected results for different inputs. The `unittest.main()` call at the end runs all the tests defined in the class.

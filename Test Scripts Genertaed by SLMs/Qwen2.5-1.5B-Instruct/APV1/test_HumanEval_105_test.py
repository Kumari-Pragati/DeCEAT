You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_105_code import by_length
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def by_length(arr):
    """
    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from
    "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".

    For example:
      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   
            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] 
            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]
      return ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
    
      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
      arr = []
      return []
    
      If the array has any strange number ignore it:
      arr = [1, -1 , 55] 
            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]
            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]
      return = ['One']

This code snippet defines a `by_length` function as described in the problem statement and includes a `TestByLength` class with several test cases using the `unittest` framework to ensure the function behaves correctly under various conditions.

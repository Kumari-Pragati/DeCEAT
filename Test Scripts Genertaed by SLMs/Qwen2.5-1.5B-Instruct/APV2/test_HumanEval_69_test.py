Write a complete unittest test suite for the following Python function.
Follow all rules carefully.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_69_code import search
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such value exists, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''
    frq = [0] * (max(lst) + 1)
    for i in lst:
        frq[i] += 1

    ans = -1
    for i in range(1, len(frq)):
        if frq[i] >= i:
            ans = i

    return ans

import unittest

# Provided function
from HumanEval_69_code import search

class TestSearch(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_search(self):
        self.assertEqual(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]), 2)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]), 3)
        self.assertEqual(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]), -1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This solution includes a `unittest` test case named `TestSearch`. It tests the `search` function with three different inputs to ensure its correctness according to the problem description.

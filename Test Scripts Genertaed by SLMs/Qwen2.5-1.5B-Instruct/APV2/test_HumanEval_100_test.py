You are an expert Python programmer whose primary role is to write comprehensive unittest test suites. Be professional, precise, and output only runnable Python code.
user
Write a complete unittest test suite for the following Python function.
Follow all rules carefully.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_100_code import make_a_pile
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """

    return [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]

import unittest

# Provided function to be tested
from HumanEval_100_code import make_a_pile

class TestMakeAPile(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_make_a_pile(self):
        # Test cases covering different scenarios
        self.assertEqual(make_a_pile(3), [3, 5, 7])
        self.assertEqual(make_a_pile(4), [4, 6, 8, 10])
        self.assertEqual(make_a_pile(5), [5, 7, 9, 11, 13])
        self.assertEqual(make_a_pile(2), [2, 4, 6])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes several test cases that cover various inputs as specified in the problem description. It uses the `assertEqual` method to check if the output of `make_a_pile` matches the expected results.

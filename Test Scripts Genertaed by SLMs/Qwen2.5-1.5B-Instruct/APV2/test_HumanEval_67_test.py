Write a complete unittest test suite for the following Python function.
Follow all rules carefully.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_67_code import fruit_distribution
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    """
    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit. This basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represents the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket, return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    
    For example:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) -> 19 - 5 - 6 = 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19
    """
    lis = []
    for i in s.split(' '):
        if i.isdigit():
            lis.append(int(i))
    return n - sum(lis)

import unittest

# Provided function to be tested
from HumanEval_67_code import fruit_distribution

class TestFruitDistribution(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_fruit_distribution(self):
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19), 8)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3), 2)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100), 95)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120), 19)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes four test cases covering various scenarios as described in the docstring of the `fruit_distribution` function. It uses the `assertEqual` method to check if the returned value matches the expected result. If any of these tests fail, it will raise an assertion error indicating which specific case failed.

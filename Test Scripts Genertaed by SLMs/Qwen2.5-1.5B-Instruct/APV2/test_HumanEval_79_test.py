Write a complete unittest test suite for the following Python function.
Follow all rules carefully.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_79_code import decimal_to_binary
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
        decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
        decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """

    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"


assistant

import unittest

# Provided function to be tested
from HumanEval_79_code import decimal_to_binary

class TestDecimalToBinary(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_decimal_to_binary(self):
        self.assertEqual(decimal_to_binary(15), "db1111db")
        self.assertEqual(decimal_to_binary(32), "db100000db")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes a single test case that checks if `decimal_to_binary` correctly converts the numbers 15 and 32 into their binary representations as specified.

Write a complete unittest test suite for the following Python function.
Follow all rules carefully.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_16_code import count_distinct_characters
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """

    return len(set(string.lower()))


assistant

import unittest

# Provided function
from HumanEval_16_code import count_distinct_characters

class TestCountDistinctCharacters(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_count_distinct_characters(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'), 3)
        self.assertEqual(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'), 4)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This completes the unittest test suite for the `count_distinct_characters` function as per your requirements.

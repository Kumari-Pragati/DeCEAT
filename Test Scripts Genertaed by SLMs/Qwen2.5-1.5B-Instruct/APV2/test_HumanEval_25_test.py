Write a complete unittest test suite for the following Python function.
Follow all rules carefully.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_25_code import factorize
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
from typing import List


def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)

    import math

        self.assertEqual(factorize(8), [2, 2, 2])

        self.assertEqual(factorize(70), [2, 5, 7])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This completes the unittest test suite for the `factorize` function as per your requirements.

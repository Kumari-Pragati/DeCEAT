Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_115_code import max_fill
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    """
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 1
        Output: 6

    Example 2:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 2
        Output: 5
    
    Example 3:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
            bucket_capacity : 5
        Output: 0

    Constraints:
        * all wells have the same length
        * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
        * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
        * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
        * 1 <= capacity <= 10
    """
    import math
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr) / capacity) for arr in grid])

This script defines a `max_fill` function as described and includes a `TestMaxFill` class with three test cases to verify its correctness using the `unittest` framework. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures that the tests can be run directly if this file is executed as the main program.

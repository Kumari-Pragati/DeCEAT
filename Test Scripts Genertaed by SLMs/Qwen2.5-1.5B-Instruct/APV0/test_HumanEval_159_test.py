Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_159_code import eat
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    You should return a list of:
        [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
          the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    If there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Examples:
    eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    """
    if need <= remaining:
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else:
        return [number + remaining, 0]

import unittest

# Function to be tested
from HumanEval_159_code import eat

class TestEatFunction(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_eat(self):
        # Test case 1
        result = eat(5, 6, 10)
        self.assertEqual(result, [11, 4])

        # Test case 2
        result = eat(4, 8, 9)
        self.assertEqual(result, [12, 1])

        # Test case 3
        result = eat(1, 10, 10)
        self.assertEqual(result, [11, 0])

        # Test case 4
        result = eat(2, 11, 5)
        self.assertEqual(result, [7, 0])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script imports `unittest` module, defines the `eat` function as provided in the question, and then creates a test class `TestEatFunction` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains four test cases using the `assertEqual` method to verify the correctness of the `eat` function against expected outcomes. Finally, it runs the tests when executed directly.

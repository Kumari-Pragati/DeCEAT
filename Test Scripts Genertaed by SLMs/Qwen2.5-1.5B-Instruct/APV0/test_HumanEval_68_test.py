Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_68_code import pluck
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def pluck(arr):
    """
    Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes,
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found, return the node that has the smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [smallest_value, its index].
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4, 2, 3]
        Output: [2, 1]

    Example 2:
        Input: [1, 2, 3]
        Output: [2, 1]

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []

    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
        * 0 <= node.value
    """
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return []
    evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, arr))
    if evens == []:
        return []
    return [min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))]

This code snippet defines a `pluck` function as described in the problem statement and includes a `TestPluck` class with several test cases using the `unittest` framework to verify the correctness of the `pluck` function.

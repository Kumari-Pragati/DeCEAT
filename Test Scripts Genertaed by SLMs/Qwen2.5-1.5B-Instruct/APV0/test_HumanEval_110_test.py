Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_110_code import exchange
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
    """

    odd = 0
    even = 0
    for i in lst1:
        if i % 2 == 1:
            odd += 1
    for i in lst2:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even += 1
    if even >= odd:
        return "YES"
    return "NO"

import unittest

# Define the function to test
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    # Your implementation here...

class TestExchange(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_exchange(self):
        self.assertEqual(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]), "YES")
        self.assertEqual(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(exchange([1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]), "YES")
        self.assertEqual(exchange([1, 3, 5, 7], [1, 3, 5, 9]), "NO")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This code snippet defines a `unittest` test case class named `TestExchange`. The `test_exchange` method contains several assertions to check the correctness of the `exchange` function. The `unittest.main()` call at the end makes the tests executable when run as a standalone script.

Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_151_code import double_the_difference
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i % 2 != 0 and "." not in str(i)])

import unittest

# Function to be tested
from HumanEval_151_code import double_the_difference

class TestDoubleTheDifference(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_double_the_difference(self):
        self.assertEqual(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]), 10)
        self.assertEqual(double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]), 0)
        self.assertEqual(double_the_difference([9, -2]), 81)
        self.assertEqual(double_the_difference([0]), 0)
        self.assertEqual(double_the_difference([]), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script imports `unittest` and defines a class `TestDoubleTheDifference` within it. The `test_double_the_difference` method contains assertions to check the correctness of the `double_the_difference` function against various test cases. Finally, the `unittest.main()` call at the end makes the tests executable when run as a standalone script.

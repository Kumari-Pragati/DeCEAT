Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_87_code import get_row
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def get_row(lst, x):
    """
    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as nested lists,
    which is similar to a matrix; however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst and integer x, find occurrences of x in the list,
    and return a list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, column), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
    """

    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])

import unittest

# Function to be tested
from HumanEval_87_code import get_row

class TestGetRow(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_get_row(self):
        self.assertEqual(get_row([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]], 1),
                         [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)])
        self.assertEqual(get_row([], 1), [])
        self.assertEqual(get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3),
                         [(2, 2)])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script imports `unittest` and defines a test case class `TestGetRow` within it. It includes two test cases (`test_get_row`) to verify the correctness of the `get_row` function using assertEqual methods. The first test case checks the function against the provided examples, while the second and third test cases cover edge cases where the input might not have any matches or might be an empty list. Finally, the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block runs all tests when the script is executed directly.

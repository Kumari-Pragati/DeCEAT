Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_32_code import find_zero
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + .... + xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.

This script defines the `find_zero` function and includes a unit test case using the `unittest` framework to verify its correctness. The `TestFindZero` class contains two test cases that check the function's behavior with given inputs.

Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_127_code import intersection
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".

    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    """
    def is_prime(num):
        if num == 1 or num == 0:
            return False
        if num == 2:
            return True
        for i in range(2, num):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    l = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    r = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    length = r - l
    if length > 0 and is_prime(length):
        return "YES"
    return "NO"

This code snippet defines a `unittest` test case class named `TestIntersection`. It contains a single method `test_intersection`, which tests the `intersection` function with different inputs and checks if the output matches the expected results. The `is_prime` helper function is used to verify if a number is prime before comparing the lengths of the intersections.

Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_67_code import fruit_distribution
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    """
    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit. This basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represents the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket, return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    
    For example:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) -> 19 - 5 - 6 = 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19
    """
    lis = []
    for i in s.split(' '):
        if i.isdigit():
            lis.append(int(i))
    return n - sum(lis)

import unittest

# Function to be tested
from HumanEval_67_code import fruit_distribution

class TestFruitDistribution(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_fruit_distribution(self):
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19), 8)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3), 2)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100), 95)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120), 19)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script imports `unittest` module and defines a class `TestFruitDistribution` which inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It includes a method `test_fruit_distribution` that uses assertions to check the correctness of the `fruit_distribution` function against provided data points. Finally, it calls `unittest.main()` to run the tests when the script is executed directly.

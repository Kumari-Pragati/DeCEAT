Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_69_code import search
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such value exists, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''
    frq = [0] * (max(lst) + 1)
    for i in lst:
        frq[i] += 1

    ans = -1
    for i in range(1, len(frq)):
        if frq[i] >= i:
            ans = i

    return ans

import unittest

# Function to be tested
from HumanEval_69_code import search

class TestSearch(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_search(self):
        self.assertEqual(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]), 2)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]), 3)
        self.assertEqual(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]), -1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script imports `unittest` and defines a test case class `TestSearch` within the same module as the `search` function. It includes two test cases using the `assertEqual` method to verify the correctness of the `search` function against provided data points. Finally, it runs all tests when executed directly.

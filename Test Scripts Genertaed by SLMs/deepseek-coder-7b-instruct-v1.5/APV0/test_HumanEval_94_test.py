### Instruction:
Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_94_code import skjkasdkd
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """You are given a list of integers.
    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.

    Examples:
    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10
    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25
    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13
    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11
    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3
    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7
    """

    def isPrime(n):
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    maxx = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(lst):
        if lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]):
            maxx = lst[i]
        i += 1

    result = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(maxx))
    return result


### Response:
Here is a unittest script for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_94_code import skjkasdkd

class TestSkjkasdkd(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_skjkasdkd(self):
        self.assertEqual(skjkasdkd([0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]), 10)
        self.assertEqual(skjkasdkd([1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1]), 25)
        self.assertEqual(skjkasdkd([1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3]), 13)
        self.assertEqual(skjkasdkd([0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6]), 11)
        self.assertEqual(skjkasdkd([0,81,12,3,1,21]), 3)
        self.assertEqual(skjkasdkd([0,8,1,2,1,7]), 7)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script creates a test case for each of the examples provided in the function's docstring. It uses the `assertEqual` method to check if the output of the `skjkasdkd` function matches the expected output. If any of these tests fail, the unittest framework will report the failure.

Please note that you need to have the `HumanEval_94_code` module with the `skjkasdkd` function defined in it for this script to work. If the function is defined in a different module, you should replace `HumanEval_94_code` with the correct module name.

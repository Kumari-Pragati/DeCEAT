### Instruction:
Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_142_code import sum_squares
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def sum_squares(lst):
    """"
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126
    """
    result = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(lst[i] ** 2)
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            result.append(lst[i] ** 3)
        else:
            result.append(lst[i])
    return sum(result)


### Response:
Here is a unittest script for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_142_code import sum_squares

class TestSumSquares(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([]), 0)

    def test_single_element_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([1]), 1)
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([-1]), -1)

    def test_multiple_elements_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([1,2,3]), 6)
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([-1,-5,2,-1,-5]), -126)

    def test_index_multiple_of_3_and_4(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([3,4,5,6,7,8,9]), 110)
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([-3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,-9]), -110)

    def test_index_not_multiple_of_3_or_4(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([10,11,12,13,14,15]), 120)
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([-10,-11,-12,-13,-14,-15]), -120)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script includes several test cases to ensure that the `sum_squares` function is working as expected. It tests the function with empty lists, lists with single elements, lists with multiple elements, lists where the index is a multiple of 3 and 4, and lists where the index is not a multiple of 3 or 4.

### Instruction:
Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_127_code import intersection
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".

    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    """
    def is_prime(num):
        if num == 1 or num == 0:
            return False
        if num == 2:
            return True
        for i in range(2, num):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    l = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    r = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    length = r - l
    if length > 0 and is_prime(length):
        return "YES"
    return "NO"


### Response:
Here is a unittest script for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_127_code import intersection

class TestIntersection(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_intersection_prime(self):
        self.assertEqual(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)), "YES")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)), "NO")

    def test_intersection_not_prime(self):
        self.assertEqual(intersection((1, 3), (2, 4)), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((2, 5), (3, 7)), "NO")

    def test_intersection_empty(self):
        self.assertEqual(intersection((1, 2), (3, 4)), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((5, 6), (7, 8)), "NO")

    def test_intersection_single_element(self):
        self.assertEqual(intersection((1, 1), (1, 1)), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((2, 2), (2, 2)), "NO")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script includes several test cases to ensure that the `intersection` function works as expected. The `test_intersection_prime` method tests cases where the length of the intersection is a prime number, the `test_intersection_not_prime` method tests cases where the length of the intersection is not a prime number, and the `test_intersection_empty` method tests cases where the intervals do not intersect. The `test_intersection_single_element` method tests cases where the intervals contain a single element.

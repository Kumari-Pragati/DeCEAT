### Instruction:
Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_62_code import derivative
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def derivative(xs: list):
    """xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
    Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 12, 20]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 6]
    """
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]


### Response:
Here is a unittest script for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_62_code import derivative

class TestDerivative(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_derivative_simple(self):
        self.assertEqual(derivative([1, 2, 3]), [2, 6])

    def test_derivative_single_term(self):
        self.assertEqual(derivative([3]), [])

    def test_derivative_empty(self):
        self.assertEqual(derivative([]), [])

    def test_derivative_large(self):
        self.assertEqual(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]), [1, 4, 12, 20])

    def test_derivative_negative_coefficients(self):
        self.assertEqual(derivative([-1, -2, -3]), [-2, -6])

    def test_derivative_zero_coefficients(self):
        self.assertEqual(derivative([0, 0, 0]), [0, 0])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script tests the derivative function with various inputs, including simple cases, cases with a single term, an empty list, large inputs, negative coefficients, and zero coefficients. It checks that the function returns the expected output for each case.

### Instruction:
Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_145_code import order_by_points
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
    order them based on their index in original list.

    For example:
    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
    >>> order_by_points([]) == []
    """
    def digits_sum(n):
        neg = 1
        if n < 0:
            n, neg = -1 * n, -1
        n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
        n[0] = n[0] * neg
        return sum(n)

    return sorted(nums, key=digits_sum)


### Response:
Here is a unittest script for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_145_code import order_by_points

class TestOrderByPoints(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_empty_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(order_by_points([]), [])

    def test_positive_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(order_by_points([1, 11, 12]), [1, 11, 12])

    def test_negative_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(order_by_points([-1, -11, -12]), [-12, -11, -1])

    def test_mixed_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]), [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11])

    def test_large_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(order_by_points([100, 101, 102]), [100, 101, 102])

    def test_large_negative_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(order_by_points([-100, -101, -102]), [-102, -101, -100])

    def test_mixed_large_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(order_by_points([100, 101, -1, -11, -12]), [-1, -11, 100, -12, 101])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script includes several test cases to ensure that the `order_by_points` function works as expected. Each test case checks a specific scenario, such as sorting an empty list, sorting a list with only positive numbers, sorting a list with only negative numbers, sorting a list with a mix of positive and negative numbers, sorting large numbers, and sorting large negative numbers.

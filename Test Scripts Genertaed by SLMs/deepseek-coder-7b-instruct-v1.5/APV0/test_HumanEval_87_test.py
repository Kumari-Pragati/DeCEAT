### Instruction:
Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_87_code import get_row
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def get_row(lst, x):
    """
    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as nested lists,
    which is similar to a matrix; however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst and integer x, find occurrences of x in the list,
    and return a list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, column), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
    """

    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])


### Response:
Here is a unittest script for the given function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_87_code import get_row

class TestGetRow(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_get_row(self):
        self.assertEqual(get_row([
            [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
            [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6],
            [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
        ], 1), [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)])

        self.assertEqual(get_row([], 1), [])

        self.assertEqual(get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3), [(2, 2)])

        self.assertEqual(get_row([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 5), [(1, 2)])

        self.assertEqual(get_row([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]], 10), [(1, 2)])

        self.assertEqual(get_row([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]], 6), [(0, 1)])

        self.assertEqual(get_row([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]], 8), [(0, 1)])

        self.assertEqual(get_row([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]], 9), [(0, 2)])

        self.assertEqual(get_row([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]], 10), [(0, 3)])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script tests the `get_row` function with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and typical cases. The `unittest.main()` call at the end runs the tests when the script is run directly.

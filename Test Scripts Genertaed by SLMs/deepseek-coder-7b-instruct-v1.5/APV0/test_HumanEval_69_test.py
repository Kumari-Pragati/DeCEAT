### Instruction:
Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_69_code import search
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such value exists, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''
    frq = [0] * (max(lst) + 1)
    for i in lst:
        frq[i] += 1

    ans = -1
    for i in range(1, len(frq)):
        if frq[i] >= i:
            ans = i

    return ans


### Response:
Here is the unittest script for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_69_code import search

class TestSearch(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_search(self):
        self.assertEqual(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]), 2)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]), 3)
        self.assertEqual(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]), -1)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]), 1)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), -1)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]), 2)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]), 3)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]), -1)
        self.assertEqual(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]), 4)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script creates a test case class `TestSearch` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. Inside this class, there is a method `test_search` that tests the `search` function with different inputs and verifies that the function returns the expected output.

The `unittest.main()` at the end of the script runs the test cases when the script is run directly.

You are an expert Python programmer whose primary role is to write comprehensive unittest test suites. Be professional, precise, and output only runnable Python code.### Instruction:
Write a complete unittest test suite for the following Python function.
Follow all rules carefully.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_33_code import sort_third
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    l = list(l)
    l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])
    return l


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_33_code import sort_third

class TestSortThird(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_sort_third(self):
        self.assertEqual(sort_third([1, 2, 3]), [1, 2, 3])
        self.assertEqual(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]), [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5])
        self.assertEqual(sort_third([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]), [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
        self.assertEqual(sort_third([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
        self.assertEqual(sort_third([]), [])
        self.assertEqual(sort_third([1]), [1])
        self.assertEqual(sort_third([1, 2]), [1, 2])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes tests for the function with different types of input including empty lists, lists of length 1, and lists of length 2. It also tests the function with lists of length 3 and greater. The test cases check that the function returns the correct output for each of these types of input.

You are an expert Python programmer whose primary role is to write comprehensive unittest test suites. Be professional, precise, and output only runnable Python code.### Instruction:
Write a complete unittest test suite for the following Python function.
Follow all rules carefully.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_96_code import count_up_to
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    For example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2, 3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2, 3, 5, 7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
    count_up_to(1) => []
    count_up_to(18) => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    """

    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(i)
    return primes


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_96_code import count_up_to

class TestCountUpTo(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_count_up_to_0(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(0), [])

    def test_count_up_to_1(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(1), [])

    def test_count_up_to_5(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(5), [2, 3])

    def test_count_up_to_11(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(11), [2, 3, 5, 7])

    def test_count_up_to_20(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(20), [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19])

    def test_count_up_to_18(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(18), [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes tests for all the examples given in the function's docstring. It checks that the function returns the correct list of prime numbers less than the input number.

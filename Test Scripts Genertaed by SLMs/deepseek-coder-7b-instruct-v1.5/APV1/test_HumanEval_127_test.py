### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_127_code import intersection

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".

    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    """
    def is_prime(num):
        if num == 1 or num == 0:
            return False
        if num == 2:
            return True
        for i in range(2, num):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    l = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    r = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    length = r - l
    if length > 0 and is_prime(length):
        return "YES"
    return "NO"


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_127_code import intersection

class TestIntersection(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_intersection_yes(self):
        self.assertEqual(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)), "YES")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((1, 5), (3, 7)), "YES")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((10, 20), (15, 25)), "YES")

    def test_intersection_no(self):
        self.assertEqual(intersection((1, 2), (3, 4)), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((5, 10), (11, 15)), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((20, 30), (35, 45)), "NO")

    def test_intersection_edge_cases(self):
        self.assertEqual(intersection((1, 1), (1, 1)), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((-1, 0), (0, 1)), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)), "NO")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes three test cases:

1. `test_intersection_yes`: This test case checks the function's output when the length of the intersection is a prime number.
2. `test_intersection_no`: This test case checks the function's output when the length of the intersection is not a prime number.
3. `test_intersection_edge_cases`: This test case checks the function's output with edge cases such as single-element intervals, overlapping intervals, and intervals that include the same start and end points.

Please note that the function `is_prime` in the `intersection` function is not efficient for large numbers. It has a time complexity of O(n), which can be improved to O(sqrt(n)) by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_115_code import max_fill

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    """
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 1
        Output: 6

    Example 2:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 2
        Output: 5
    
    Example 3:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
            bucket_capacity : 5
        Output: 0

    Constraints:
        * all wells have the same length
        * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
        * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
        * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
        * 1 <= capacity <= 10
    """
    import math
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr) / capacity) for arr in grid])


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_115_code import max_fill

class TestMaxFill(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_example_1(self):
        grid = [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
        capacity = 1
        self.assertEqual(max_fill(grid, capacity), 6)

    def test_example_2(self):
        grid = [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
        capacity = 2
        self.assertEqual(max_fill(grid, capacity), 5)

    def test_example_3(self):
        grid = [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
        capacity = 5
        self.assertEqual(max_fill(grid, capacity), 0)

    def test_single_well(self):
        grid = [[1]]
        capacity = 1
        self.assertEqual(max_fill(grid, capacity), 1)

    def test_full_wells(self):
        grid = [[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]]
        capacity = 4
        self.assertEqual(max_fill(grid, capacity), 3)

    def test_empty_wells(self):
        grid = [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]]
        capacity = 1
        self.assertEqual(max_fill(grid, capacity), 0)

    def test_capacity_1(self):
        grid = [[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]]
        capacity = 1
        self.assertEqual(max_fill(grid, capacity), 12)

    def test_capacity_greater_than_wells(self):
        grid = [[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]]
        capacity = 5
        self.assertEqual(max_fill(grid, capacity), 3)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes tests for the examples given in the problem statement, as well as additional tests for edge cases and other scenarios.

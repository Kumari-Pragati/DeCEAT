### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_123_code import get_odd_collatz

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.
    """
    if n % 2 == 0:
        odd_collatz = []
    else:
        odd_collatz = [n]
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n / 2
        else:
            n = n * 3 + 1
        if n % 2 == 1:
            odd_collatz.append(int(n))
    return sorted(odd_collatz)


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_123_code import get_odd_collatz

class TestGetOddCollatz(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_get_odd_collatz(self):
        self.assertEqual(get_odd_collatz(5), [1, 5])
        self.assertEqual(get_odd_collatz(10), [5, 10])
        self.assertEqual(get_odd_collatz(15), [1, 5, 15])
        self.assertEqual(get_odd_collatz(20), [1, 5, 15, 20])
        self.assertEqual(get_odd_collatz(2), [])
        self.assertEqual(get_odd_collatz(1), [1])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes tests for different inputs, including even numbers, odd numbers, and 1. The tests check if the function returns the correct list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.

Please note that the function `get_odd_collatz` should be in the file `HumanEval_123_code.py` for these tests to work.

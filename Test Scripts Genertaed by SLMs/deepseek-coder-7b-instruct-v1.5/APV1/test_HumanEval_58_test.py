### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_58_code import common

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.
    >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
    [1, 5, 653]
    >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
    [2, 3]
    """
    ret = set()
    for e1 in l1:
        for e2 in l2:
            if e1 == e2:
                ret.add(e1)
    return sorted(list(ret))


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_58_code import common

class TestCommon(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_common_elements(self):
        self.assertEqual(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]), [1, 5, 653])
        self.assertEqual(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]), [2, 3])
        self.assertEqual(common([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]), [])
        self.assertEqual(common([1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]), [1])
        self.assertEqual(common([], []), [])
        self.assertEqual(common([], [1, 2, 3]), [])
        self.assertEqual(common([1, 2, 3], []), [])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes tests for various scenarios, including cases where there are common elements, cases where there are no common elements, and cases where one or both of the input lists are empty.

### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_60_code import sum_to_n

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """
    return sum(range(n + 1))


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_60_code import sum_to_n

class TestSumToN(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_sum_to_n(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(30), 465)
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(100), 5050)
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(5), 15)
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(10), 55)
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(1), 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes a single test case `test_sum_to_n` that checks the output of the `sum_to_n` function against the expected results for a few different input values. The `assertEqual` method is used to check if the actual output matches the expected output.

If the actual output does not match the expected output, the test case will fail, indicating that there might be a problem with the `sum_to_n` function.

Please note that the `HumanEval_60_code` module should contain the `sum_to_n` function for this test suite to work.

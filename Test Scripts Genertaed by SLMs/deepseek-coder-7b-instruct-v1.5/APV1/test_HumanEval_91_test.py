### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_91_code import is_bored

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """

    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    return sum(sentence.startswith('I ') for sentence in sentences if sentence)


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_91_code import is_bored

class TestIsBored(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_boredoms(self):
        self.assertEqual(is_bored("Hello world"), 0)

    def test_single_boredom(self):
        self.assertEqual(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"), 1)

    def test_multiple_boredoms(self):
        self.assertEqual(is_bored("I am bored. I have nothing to do. I want to play!"), 3)

    def test_no_boredoms_with_punctuation(self):
        self.assertEqual(is_bored("Hello world!"), 0)

    def test_empty_string(self):
        self.assertEqual(is_bored(""), 0)

    def test_boredom_at_start(self):
        self.assertEqual(is_bored("I am starting this test."), 1)

    def test_boredom_at_end(self):
        self.assertEqual(is_bored("This is a test. I am ending it."), 1)

    def test_boredom_in_middle(self):
        self.assertEqual(is_bored("This is a test. I am in the middle. This is the end."), 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes tests for different scenarios:

- No boredoms
- Single boredom
- Multiple boredoms
- Boredoms with punctuation at the end of the sentence
- Empty string
- Boredom at the start of the text
- Boredom at the end of the text
- Boredom in the middle of the text

Each test checks if the function returns the expected number of boredoms for a given input string.

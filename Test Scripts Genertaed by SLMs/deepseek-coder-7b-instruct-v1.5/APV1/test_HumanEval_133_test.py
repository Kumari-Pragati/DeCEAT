### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_133_code import sum_squares

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def sum_squares(lst):
    """You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6
    """
    import math
    squared = 0
    for i in lst:
        squared += math.ceil(i) ** 2
    return squared


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_133_code import sum_squares

class TestSumSquares(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_sum_squares(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([1,2,3]), 14)
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([1,4,9]), 98)
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([1,3,5,7]), 84)
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([1.4,4.2,0]), 29)
        self.assertEqual(sum_squares([-2.4,1,1]), 6)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes a single test case that checks the output of the `sum_squares` function against the expected results for a variety of input lists. If any of these checks fail, the test suite will report a failure.

Please note that the `HumanEval_133_code` module should contain the `sum_squares` function for these tests to work. If the function is defined in a different module, you should replace `HumanEval_133_code` with the correct module name.

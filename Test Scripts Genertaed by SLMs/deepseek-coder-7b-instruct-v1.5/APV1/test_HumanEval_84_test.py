### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_84_code import solve

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.

    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".

    Variables:
        @N integer
            Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
    Output:
        a string of binary number
    """

    return bin(sum(int(i) for i in str(N)))[2:]


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_84_code import solve

class TestSolve(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_solve(self):
        self.assertEqual(solve(1000), "1")
        self.assertEqual(solve(150), "110")
        self.assertEqual(solve(147), "1100")
        self.assertEqual(solve(0), "0")
        self.assertEqual(solve(10000), "1")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes tests for various input values, including edge cases like 0 and 10000. The `assertEqual` method is used to check if the output of the `solve` function matches the expected output for each test case. If any of these checks fail, the test suite will report a failure.

Please note that the `solve` function is expected to return a string of binary number, so the expected outputs are also strings.

To run these tests, you would need to have the `HumanEval_84_code` module available in the same directory as your test file, or adjust the import statement to point to the correct location of the `solve` function.

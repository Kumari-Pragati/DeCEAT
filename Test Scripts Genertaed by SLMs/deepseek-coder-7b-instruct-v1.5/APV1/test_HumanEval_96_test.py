### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_96_code import count_up_to

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    For example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2, 3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2, 3, 5, 7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
    count_up_to(1) => []
    count_up_to(18) => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    """

    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(i)
    return primes


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_96_code import count_up_to

class TestCountUpTo(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_count_up_to(self):
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(5), [2, 3])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(11), [2, 3, 5, 7])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(0), [])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(20), [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(1), [])
        self.assertEqual(count_up_to(18), [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes a single test case `test_count_up_to` that checks the function against a variety of inputs. The `assertEqual` method is used to check that the output of the function matches the expected output for each input. If the function's output does not match the expected output, the test case will fail.

Please note that this test suite assumes that the `count_up_to` function is implemented correctly and that the function's behavior is as described in the docstring. If the function's behavior changes, the test suite may need to be updated.

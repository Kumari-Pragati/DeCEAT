### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_130_code import tri

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
    """
    if n == 0:
        return [1]
    my_tri = [1, 3]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)
        else:
            my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)
    return my_tri


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_130_code import tri

class TestTri(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_tri_zero(self):
        self.assertEqual(tri(0), [1])

    def test_tri_one(self):
        self.assertEqual(tri(1), [1, 3])

    def test_tri_two(self):
        self.assertEqual(tri(2), [1, 3, 2, 2.5])

    def test_tri_three(self):
        self.assertEqual(tri(3), [1, 3, 2, 8])

    def test_tri_negative(self):
        with self.assertRaises(IndexError):
            tri(-1)

    def test_tri_large(self):
        self.assertEqual(tri(10)[10], 100.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes tests for different cases:

- When `n` is 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- When `n` is a negative number.
- When `n` is a large number.

The `test_tri_large` test checks if the function correctly calculates the 11th number of the sequence when `n` is 10.

Please note that the `tri` function in the original question does not match the expected behavior in the test cases. The expected behavior is that the function should return a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. However, the function in the original question does not correctly calculate the Tribonacci sequence. The sequence is not correctly calculated when `n` is odd. The correct calculation of the Tribonacci sequence is not provided in the original question.
